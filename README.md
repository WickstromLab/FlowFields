The script `pyramidal-KLT.m` is based on a pyramidal implementaion of Lucas Kanade motion tracking algorithm. It can be used
to obtain flow-fields at a given instance using images. The features to be tracked in the flow are taken as points inside a masked
region. 

`VectorFieldOperations.m` contains functions for computing velocity gradients and strain-rate from velocity-fields
